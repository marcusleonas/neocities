yeah yeah i know i’m a month late, but better late than never right??

last year was a solid 7/10 for me, there was so much i should’ve done, but i also had a lot of good things happen.

i met up with my best friend after not talking for over a year. i was really nervous before, worrying about every little thing but when we started talking, it was like no time had passed at all. its like all that time didn’t happen. i hope to see her again soon, it was really nice

if i havent mentioned it somewhere else on my site, i work with a lot of theatre groups in my local area, and actually started our own for-profit theatre company with my dad. we’re putting on our first production in march, and in some ways im really nervous but others im so excited. theres a lot of worries about money, etc especially after my grandma’s passing, but im still trying to be positive 😊

i feel like this year i’m really motivated to actually stick to my resolutions. in the past i just forgot about them in a week, but im determined not to do that in 2026.

without further ado, my resolutions:

- be more creative! instead of continuously consuming content, i want to try making some and experimenting (hence me recreating this website and starting to update it again). i also want to get into art more!! im an abysmal artist, but im hoping to get better ❤️‍🩹 
- get back into web design - i used to really love making and maintaining websites but i’ve forgotten about it in the last year.
- study more 🥹 ive got my exams coming up this year, and i cant keep running from things and not studying. i want to put in at least a couple of hours a week studying
- work in my mental health & be more positive. im usually quite cynical, and i dont want to be like that anymore…
- READ MORE!! i dont read enough 🥹
- be more active

these are just some of the things i want to achieve this year, theres probably thousands more i could think of if i spent a day thinking.

on a completely different note, i also started listening to music differently, im trying to ditch playlists and actually just listen to albums/artists i like!!

thanks for reading my incoherent ramblings!! <3
